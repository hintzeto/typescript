# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Talon Hintze

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)?

    3

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |               |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |               |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |
|TypeScript               |       X       |
|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

    Write multiple functions (not necessarily part of a single piece of software) in TypeScript that demonstrates some of the following:

    * Display output to the terminal.

    * Recursion

    * Classes

    * Lists

    * Asynchronous functions

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?

    YouTube, official TypeScript documentation, ChatGPT

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?

    I plan on learning the material first by understanding what TypeScript is and its common applications. I will then plan out how to use TypeScript on a project at work and then use tutorials and other resources to build a piece of software to interact with Azure OpenAI.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?

    A piece of customized software for users to use to interact with the Azure OpenAI integration at my company.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.

    I will work on this project every day at some point between 11am and 3pm Monday-Friday.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?

    I expect to run into quite a few technical risks. Our Azure OpenAI platform is brand new and nobody knows how to use it comprehensively. I suspect I will run into problems with how to host and launch my code, making it user friendly and efficient, and integrating our Azure database into the workflow.


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|
|----------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 6/3/24   |  11:48   |  IM    | Looking into how to setup dev environment  |   1:48      |
| 6/5/24   |  11:30   |  IM    | Researching software requirements          |   2:31      |
| 6/5/24   |  6:21    |  IM    | Pivot away from initial project and restart|   2:14      |
| 6/6/24   |  8:43    |  IM    | Making library management system           |   1:52      |
| 6/7/24   |  4:50    |  IM    | Create video walkthrough and documentation |             |
|          |          |        |                                            |             |

_Note: Add more rows as needed._


## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: 

    https://github.com/hintzeto/typescript

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here:

    https://youtu.be/6v-u53M9b50

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
|Are the links above public and working?                     |    X   |
|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|    X   |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   |    X   |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |    X   |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |    X   |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.

    No stretch challenges

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.

    No

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|                   |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.

    A behavioral startegy that worked well for me was working in an environment where other people were also workings. Having the positive peer pressure to stay focused was incredibly useful. From a technical standpoint, this sprint was a disaster. My original plan for the project had to be completely scraped during the second week due to technical challenges. I had to start over from the beginning late into the second week. 

    Next sprint I plan on improving by scaling down the scope of my projects. I can have a tendency to bite off more than I can chew or attempt things I don't have a good understanding of. By setting more reasonable goals I will be able to grow quicker and avoid losing motivation and discouragement.
